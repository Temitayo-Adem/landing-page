# Landing Page Project

## Table of Contents

For this project I tried to keep it fairly simple. I started by adding an additional section to the HTML and linking the javascript file at the bottom of the HTML file.

Note: I did have some difficulty trying to add the active class to a section when it is in the viewport. I found it difficult to determine the perfect moment in which the element is in the viewport, and have currently settled on activating when the whole vertical aspect of the element is in view or when the top of the section is near the top of the screen. I decided to use setInterval to consistently check whether a section should be activated. Is there a better way?
